Eldritch Wager was made in a week for the brackeys game jam <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14">https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14</a>.

I made this one because I could. I don't love the balance and level design but the mechanic itself is definitely sound. I just need to refine this and actually make real art, and this is just a game. Wow! 

The little tidbit at the beginning was all I had time for narratively, but if I ever finish the thing, I want to make a full 3d environment and metanarrative to the thing.

Feedback is of course welcome.
