description: I'm making a wild west themed TTRPG! Here I go over my initial thoughts and approach to making the thing happen.
title: Wild West TTRPG System Development Log ep 1 
draft: true

Hi! Welcome to my first devlog! I figured I'd use this blog as a tool to get me thinking about this project again, and if I can share my thought process and inspire others to be creative and make things as well, that's an added bonus! Please feel free to use the table of contents above to jump around to stuff that you find interesting, as I'm gonna be yapping quite a bit. So, without further ado, let's get started!

## Where did we start?

This wild west TTRPG project extravaganza started back when I was playing 5e very regularly (over four years ago, holy hell i'm old). I've since curtailed my use of the 5e system to take up playing more independent work to draw from in terms of system structure and approach to design, however the wild west system's old doccuments that i'll be picking up are still very rooted in that old 5e-style. It leaned heavily into that moment to moment combat that D&D is well known for and it dealt in minute stat values and to-hit bonuses to weapons and heavy resource management. In other words, I think my digital game design practices crossed with my overwhelming 5e experience to that point resulted in a rather creative, yet bewildering network of systems and ideas that aren't well suited to the TTRPG medium, or at least to the experiences I want to create with this system. Let's take a look at what remnants remain and what I want to do with them.

### Combat

As much as I love the detail and ideas behind my combat mechanics, they were incredibly overcomplicated, and, in fact, the system as a whole actually looked to de-incentivese combat as a core design direction. That's a direction I intend to maintain from the original doccuments, so (in retrospect) this complexity was completely unwarranted. I want combat to be bad. Bad as in "incredibly costly", not "unfun". Something that pushes players to look for a nonviolent solution, but still remains a last ditch option in a dire crisis. I assume many tilt their heads at this decision. The wild west ficiton, after all, is rife with gunslinging, cannons, gatling guns, and shootouts. However in the traditional TTRPG system, these events are treated as a puzzle. A fun "battle of the day"
