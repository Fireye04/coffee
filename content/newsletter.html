    <h2>What is this?</h2>
        
        <p>This is my newsletter! In addition to fully supporting RSS (If anyone is having problems there please open an issue on the github!), I'm now adding a newsletter for those who have no idea what RSS is.</p>

        <p>There are a few options for what you want to subscribe to, so I can minimize the amount of unwanted emails I send. Until I end up automating this system at some point, I'm going to send emails whenever something happens. I'm super irregular, but here's each topic and how regularly I've updated each item in the past. I will not send more than 1 email per week, regardless of topic.</p>

    <h2>Topics</h2>

        <ul>
    <li><strong>Projects-</strong> I've posted a new project! | <i>~1 per 2 months, or perhaps longer</i></li>
    <li><strong>Blog-</strong> New blog post is out! | <i>~1 per month.</i></li>
    <li><strong>Writing-</strong> I wrote a new story! | <i>~1 per 2 months, or perhaps longer.</i></li>
    <li><strong>Website Updates-</strong> I added something to the website! | <i>~2 per month.</i></li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Cancelling!</h2>

    <p>To cancel, simply use the above form with your email, and tick any or all topics that you'd like to recieve. Sending in the form with no topics ticked will automatically remove your email from my database. If this isn't working for whatever reason, please open up an issue on my github or reach out so I can hopefully repair the system and get your email removed.</p>
