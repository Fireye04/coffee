A couple months worth of work so far, tavern 2 is my first long-term
project I've attempted in quite some time. It's a game concept rooted in the idea
of a stardew-valley-esque tavern management sim with deep relationship and bartering
mechanics. At the moment I'm working on a tech demo before I start going public with
development, but I plan to get said demo done before the end of August 2024. (cut to
me not updating the website post august and getting bullied by the 2 whole
<strike>visitors</strike> bots that notice). You can check granular progress with the
link below that I actually keep up to date.

### Update:
I have paused the project while waiting for art. It is feature complete, however still requires art and content. The code is available below.
