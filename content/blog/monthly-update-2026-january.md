Alrighty here we go.

## Global Game Jam
I put together [An Unnamed Gas Station (in the middle of nowhere)](/projects/gas-station) for GGJ this year, and helped organize the event at my uni, so we could jam in person. If you haven't done an in-person game jam, you haven't lived.

## Treehouse

Got a lot of progress on the treehouse done over january. 
Lots of refactoring done, a lot more to do.
Gonna let the thing mostly speak for itself though, so you'll have to wait till I release it.

## Open Source

### Noctalia

I finally cracked and swapped out my waybar setup for noctalia. It may be more customizable, but my god I just don't have that kinda time. It does everything I need and looks great! Well, almost every thing. It's still missing reverse scrolling. [FOR NOW](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell/pull/1676)! MWAHAHAHA!! (I did this instead of stats homework)

### Niri

I got an event stream for the [hot corner pressure PR](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) implemented! 
That's a big step towards completing the damn thing, and I can feel myself getting closer. 
The last big thing I need to do is pointer capture on corner enter, so it gets stopped, doesn't overflow into adjacent monitors, and can actually impart pressure onto the hot corner.
Otherwise, should be coming soon(ish)!

Looking at hot corner bindings at *some* point as well though!

## Framework

My old LG gram has finally died! 
And a framework 16 rises from the ashes! 
This thing is actually beautiful, and I absolutely love how customizable and user friendly this machine is.
The BIOS is custom too! 
Really neat stuff!

Overall, there have been a couple hiccups, but the hardware is open, and that's all I need. 
The PCIE lanes in the back are super appealing, so I might actually try modding the thing. 
An audio card for low latency audio would be super cool.
A wireless access point would also be totally sick for LAN multiplayer game testing! 
The sky's the limit!

And finally, the swap between computers took maybe 10 minutes. NixOS is fucking sick. 

# Retrospective

It feels like I got a lot done but it sure doesn't look like it! 
Sorry again I'm late on this, hoping I'm on this more for febuary's monthly report, but we'll see!

The nodeletter specifically is ready but we're running into pipeline issues, so we'll see how it goes. 

# Plans

Again, more treehouse! 
Gotta finish this one up; I want to get it out.

Cabin is gonna go on back-burner a bit. 
I'll work on it if I feel like it, but no guarantees!

Gas station was an interesting project, and I liked the tooling quite a bit. 
I might take a week to polish up the tools to publish them.
I want more people to make disco-like RPGs so if I can make a toolkit for it, maybe I can inspire more creative work in this vein!

## Conclusion

I can feel my brain melting okbyeeeeeeeeee
