    <p>Inspired by the geniuses behind <a href="https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/"
        target="_blank">perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com</a> and those that came before.</p>

    <p>Also thanks to the person known as "doodle" on my uni's cs discord, who had a <a href="https://doodleta.co/"
        target="_blank">similar site</a> up for themselves, which in turn inspired me to make my own spin-off. Go check
      them out! :)</p>

    <p>And of course, this website's <a href="https://github.com/Fireye04/Fireye04" target="_blank">Github Page</a>, if
      you want to check it out. If you find any issues with the site I would really appreciate if you could open up an issue!</p>
