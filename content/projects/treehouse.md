Imagine a modern setting but focused on the PCs in a treehouse where each characters' troubles, flaws and vices are represented as "classes".

## Current progress

 Feature-wise it's mostly there, with a few additions and tweaks here and there, but content-wise, it's a barren wasteland, which is somewhat terrifying. I reckon the bread and butter of the game will be each flaw, vice, and trouble's interaction with the rules, as each will have deep integration with the systems at play and I can't wait to see how the dynamics play out. Gotta make it exist first though haha.
