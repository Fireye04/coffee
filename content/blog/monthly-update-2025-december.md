Heeeeey everyone. 
So... January 7th. 
No December update. 
What gives?

Not to worry, I'm here! I think what happened is I finally passed my discreet math class and got back so much free time that I promptly got lost in the sauce.
Imma be real, this one's gonna be silly, as I've been in the goddamn trenches since new year's. Happy new year by the way!

## Twee narrative

Yeah the thing is fucked.
I crunched for at least a week straight trying to get that thing done and it still crashed when I needed it most.
Very depressing.

If you're down for some github trawling, you can find it and play it on my github, but I'm not gonna fully put it out there till I can polish it up a bit more and add a couple more random events.

## New year, new Niri PR

I've started up on another [Niri PR](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/pull/3016)! 

This time, I'm working on adding pressure-based hot corner triggering.
I should look at adding spawn-sh to hot corners as well though.

## GDT Logo

Remember that open source game developer webring I made awhile back? No? [Game Devs Together](https://gdt.fireye.coffee/) anyone?
Well it does, in fact, still exist! 

And even better, GDT Member [mailoeckchen](https://mailoeckchen.neocities.org/) contributed some splendid art for the thing, as well as some much needed widget code updates. We even have navigation buttons now. Snazzy! 

## Treehouse TTRPG Design

I've been chippping away at the treehouse game here and there to hopefully get the thing released at some point. 
Nothing huge, but we're seeing incremental progress.

## Music!

I DO MAKE MUSIC, I SWEAR!! 
I even have Ardour open right now! Trust! 

I keep meaning to record, but unfortunately all of my time spent playing music is for relaxation, and the moment I start trying to record it I stop relaxing.
I think that means I have to dedicate some project time to it as well. Drat.

SIKE! After writing this I got inspired and started making music and I released something that should be [up now](/music)!

## Codeberg

I've been considering migrating a lot of my code over to codeberg from github. 
I hate how reliant I am on a microsoft service, not to mention the endless copilot throat shoving. 

No thank you.

# Retrospective?

That's it! That's all I did in december, and absolutely nothing else. Please don't scroll down past this poorly plagiarized [hbomberguy segue](https://youtu.be/yDp3cB5fHXQ?si=QLmxzVpUw4Enzwgn&t=6515)... 

ah you saw it.

## THE OPENVPN SERVER... WITH A STEEL CHAIR

I WON! I BEAT IT! 
I've been bitching about this thing since at least [june](/blog/monthly-update-2025-june)! 

I'll keep specific details light in the interest of security, but I've got pretty seamless LAN Access and I've been fucking around with some old laptops!

### Deployments 

First we got a forgejo instance (fuck microsoft). They seem to be the only ones working on some form of git server [federation protocols](https://forgefed.org/) and I want to support that how I can.

Jellyfin is a no-brainer (fuck spotify), and etherpad is actually so damn neat (fuck google).

Rocket.Chat is great as well (fuck discord), and finally, I still need to figure out freshrss (fuck social media algorithms) and syncthing (fuck google/microsoft again), but they both look incredibly helpful.

As far as future deployments go, openproject (fuck atlassian) is almost certaintly coming soon, and Memos (Actually, idk with this one) looks really neat.
Please feel free to send me any suggestions though!

### Colmena

[Colmena](https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena) is this crazy neat little deployment tool for NixOS based systems! 
It's unfathomably useful, and I only see its utility growing as I add more hardware and software to my stack. 

Basically, it lets you build and deploy a NixOS derivation remotely via SSH. 
Running servers on Nix is both really great (because nix is really great), and also a tadbit awful, as not everything's packaged and compose2nix doesn't work 100% of the time (though it's absolutely incredible with what it can do).

### Other stuff

I think I'll save a lot of the ranting for a later blog post so I can provide a bit more of a resource for others who might want to set up something similar.
OPNSense + OpenVPN + NixOS + Colmena is such a neat combo and I'd love to show other newbies what little I've learned so far. 

# Retrospective (for real)

Ok that's it for real this time.
Sorry again the thing is late! 

But hey, in my defense, the nodeletter is late too! (It's coming soon, and we'll be back on the schedule for the rest of the year, promise!)

I did a good amount of treehouse work, and more TTRPG work is definitely forthcoming! I'm looking at getting treehouse done as soon as I can, then hopefully moving to wild west, but that's still TBD. 

# Plans

More Treehouse! 
I also want to do more music, so expect maybe another song or two?

I want to do more work on my cabin game but I almost certainly won't be able to, so consider this a bonus point.

Also, I'll be doing GGJ so I'll probably be a tadbit late on january's monthly so I can cover that there as well :3

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading! I'll be back next month, have a great one!
