title: The Party
---
Why am I here? I know I don't like parties. It's so loud. All I've been doing is standing in the corner, holding an almost empty cup, watching everyone have a good time. It's so wierd how people are able to just have fun at parties. Or maybe I'm the wierd one. I check my watch. 11:35. I've been here for over an hour and a half. I look around for Allison, my roomate and unfortunately my ride. I catch a glimpse of her, very drunk, leaned over on some guy. Typical. 

"You're scowling" Notes a voice to my left. I turn. Like everyone else at this party, I don't recognize them. They're short and well dressed, eyes adorned with some admittedly beautiful makeup. They're wearing a casual smirk that conveys a calm swagger that generally eminates from their entire person. "It's a party, you're supposed to enjoy yourself, no?" They say.

"I don't know you." I say, looking them over suspiciously.

"Nope! But why go to a party if not to talk to strangers?" They ask.

"Because your bitchass roomate bulied you into it?" I offer, glaring daggers at Allison. The nerve on her, finally asking me to do something with her then abandoning me for some boytoy the moment we get here.

"Well I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been in this corner?" They ask.

"An hour and thirty seven minutes." I answer. "But who's counting?"

"Jeez, that sucks. Tried talking to people?" They ask. "You meet all types, case in point" They gesture to me with a slim grin.

"Yeah, unfortunately I bring a certain vibe to the table that people generally don't love" I say, recalling the many many awkward, silent, or plain failed interactions I'd had with others over the years, the most recent one at that very party. "I'm complete garbage at socializing. It's a minor miracle that I haven't yet fucked up this conversation in one way or another." They laugh. That's new. 

"I'll tell you a secret" they say. "You can't really fuck up a conversation when your metric of success is human connection." 

"How do you figure that? I think I could pretty easily." I respond

"Okay, worst case scenario, let's say I walk up to you and I say: 'Hi! You're incredibly ugly, and I thought I should say something in case you didn't already know.', what do you do?" 

"I tell you to piss off."

"Boom. There you go" They say, grinning.

"What? You clearly fucked that interaction up."

"Ah! But it was an interaction, was it not?"

"I mean... yes?"

"That's human connection! To me, I've succeeded."

"I just told you to piss off! That's hardly a connection" I sputter.

"Potato, potato" They say with a shrug, pronouncing both words identically. "And consider, It'll never get that bad because you're never going to intentially insult a stranger. There's no way to go but up!" 

"You're crazy" I say, a smile creeping its way onto my face.

"Maybe, but I'm having fun aren't I?" 

"Whatever" I respond playfully.

"So tell me, corner girl, how does someone ''garbage at socializing'' get bullied into coming to a big party for..."

"One hour and thirty nine minutes" I fill in, almost automatically, then I pause to consider the question. I sigh. "My roommate Allison asked me if I wanted to go." 

"Just asked?"

"I mean, yeah. We never hang out these days so I just said yes. Silly me for thinking she'd stick with her wierdo roommate." I'm not sure why I'm sharing this with a total stranger, but it's oddly nice to tell someone how I'm feeling, crappy as it is. My eyes, picking up on the subject matter, drift back over to Allison hoping to find her without the himbo, but I recieve no such luck, catching her in the middle of laugh, one arm comfortably around his shoulders. My stomach sinks and I stifle a gag. I let out an exasperated sigh and sink to the floor, my back sliding along the drywall all the way down. My new friend follows my gaze, their mouth forming an O of understanding as their eyes land on Allison. 

"Hey," They sit down next to me. "I've been there. It sucks, but some people are just into men. The sooner you get over her..."

"Whoa whoa whoa! Back up! We're just friends!" I raise my hands defensively. "I'm not into women anyway!" They pause for a second, their lips pursed into a thin, flat line. Our eyes meet. 

"Girl..." They pause. I raise an eyebrow, daring them to finish the sentence. We hold the standstill for a moment. They break into their trademark grin "Eh, who am I kidding, it's your canon event"

"What does that even mean?" 

"You'll figure it out!"

What? I'll figure it out? I've already figured it out! I like men, not women! I've had great relationships with guys! Cole was a sweetheart! Adrian was hot as hell! Jake! Uhhhh... Jake was... Umm. Alright Jake kinda sucked. But that's besides the point! I'm not gay! I'm **clearly** not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with being gay! It's just not me!

"Hey, in other news, I never got your name." 

"It's "
