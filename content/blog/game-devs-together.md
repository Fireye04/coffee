## TLDR

Hi! I made a webring! An OPEN SOURCE webring! If you're a gamedev with a personal website, you can join it [here](https://gdt.fireye.coffee)!

## What is it?

The quick one-liner is that GDT is an open source indie web style webring for game developers who run personal websites.

Like a normal webring it serves to connect indie websites to each other without reliance on a conventional search engines. It focuses its scope in a bit more than many conventional webrings (specifically to just game developers) in order to hopefully provide a more curated experience for the indie web surfer who might be interested in finding more indie games and game developers to follow.

More importantly though, this also allows the community to focus itself and become a lot more useful to its members. Right now, I've set up a [forum](https://github.com/Fireye04/Game-Devs-Together/discussions) where people can talk, and I've intentionally kept it open as a resource for all game developers and aspiring game developers to come in and chat, not just the ones with websites.

Ideally, once GDT grows a bit, I'm hoping to see if the community can tackle a community project or two, taking advantage of the group's open source nature, but till then I'll be hanging out.

I'm hoping to go advertise it in a few other indie web forums and areas to hopefully gain some kind of critical mass or initial userbase, but who knows haha.
