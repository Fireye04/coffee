description: I'm making a wild west themed TTRPG! Here I go over my initial thoughts and approach to making the thing happen.
title: Wild West TTRPG System Development Log ep 1 
draft: true
---

Hi! Welcome to my first devlog! I figured I'd use this blog as a tool to get me thinking about this project again, and if I can share my thought process and inspire others to be creative and make things as well, that's an added bonus! Please feel free to use the table of contents above to jump around to stuff that you find interesting, as I'm gonna be yapping quite a bit. So, without further ado, let's get started!

## Where did we start?

This wild west TTRPG project extravaganza started back when I was playing 5e very regularly (over four years ago, holy hell i'm old). I've since curtailed my use of the 5e system to take up playing more independent work to draw from in terms of system structure and approach to design, however the wild west system's old doccuments that i'll be picking up are still very rooted in that old 5e-style 

## What are my goals?
