After hyperfixating on the wild west as a setting, I wanted to play a ttrpg in it. However, it was incredibly difficult to find a good one at the time so I decided to make my own. It was initally very 5e heavy in terms of influence but I'm pivoting away from that in the most recent revision as you can read about in [this devlog](/blog/wild-west-devlog-1/). 

New documents should appear below soon when I am able to make them, and keep an eye out for the next devlog. Yell at me if it takes too long.
