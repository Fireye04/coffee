Man I'm bored.

So bored. 

Ah shit, you've gone and stepped in a puddle, great job, ya gonk. Now your socks are wet.

Why the hell is it even rainy, anyway? 

Those dumbasses at Auracorp aren't doing their damn jobs.

Ugh, squish, squish, squish, Ick, Ick, Ick.

God I can't with these damn socks. 

I'll take em off at the stop.

...

Bored! 

Bored, Bored, Bored!

Bororororeedddddd. 

Boooooorrrrrrr--

Oh hey wait Mac said they were headed to the ripperdoc yesterday; I should check in to see how they're doing.

Ah shit, right, my fucking HUD is gone, great.

Fuck this HUD upgrade, man I thought it would be easy.

One day without your HUD, how hard could it be?

Pretty damn hard as it turns out. Preem.

Shoulda gone for that loaner HUD, cheap ass gonk.

How did people even survive without HUDs back in the day, my god.



...

Thank goodnesss those socks are off, ugh. 

Did people back in the day just sit at train stations and... do nothing? 

Like, everyone's on their HUD and I'm just... sitting here. 

Awkwardly. 

Real awkwardly.

Ugh make it stop.

Oh shit I zoned out staring at them didn't I<abbr title="I swear I just wanted to use an em dash I don't use AI please believe me I just like em dashes i'm a nerd leave me aloooooone">--</abbr> oh shit oh shit did they notice? oh where do I look.. NO DON'T LOOK BACK AT THEM IDIOT! WHERE'S THE TRAIN ALREADY PLEASE MAKE IT STOP.

...

Guess what? Still bored.

bored bored bored

So bored that the word bored is starting to mean nothing. 

bored. 

board.

browed.

broad.

borrowed.

I wonder how the word bored became a thing. 

Like what's the history behind bored. 

barred. 

brine. 

bork.

Oh hey train's here... finally. 

What a day. 

You know, I don't think I've ever gone this far in the day without hearing the news one way or another. 

Honestly in a really weird way, it's kinda relaxing.

And now I have a categorical list of slant rhymes for "bored" in my brain for some reason.

Are those even slant rhymes? 

Maybe I should write a rock song. 

Ditch this cushy corpo job, get out there, and live life.

Learn Guitar.

Hit the stage. 

What do musicians sing about?

Usually their favorite kinda soda or something like that.

That sounds... fine? 

Maybe?

I think?

I guess I don't really know.

Well, can I sing about other stuff?

Is that allowed?

Do I know any musicians that do that?

Hmmm...

Dad used to listen to a girl that sung about other stuff when I was a kid I think.

What was her name?

Lightning J or something silly like that.

I should have a cool rock name. 

Something like chrome eyeball... no. 

Ripper axe... no.

Eh, I'll workshop it.

But yeah, what did she sing about again?

Something about corpos this capitalism that.

I don't think she liked corpos much.

Which is silly, I mean, how would anyone survive without the corps.

Like if you don't get a corpo job the streets would eat you alive.

Corps are necessary.

.. right?

I mean... Nomads do perfectly fine without corps. 

But they steal stuff from the corps, if we didn't have corps they wouldn't be able to survive either.

Ok then case closed, corps are good.

.. But mac's brother did get his skull exploded back in march because he got promoted to counterintel.

Like the world is definitely not better off for him... Or for his loved ones for that matter. 

Poor mac. I hope they're doing better.

I should reach out... Ah shit, yep no HUD, that's right.

Well, as a mental excersise, let's just see if we can create a world that exists without corps and we can compare it to what we have now.

So, let's start by--- 

FUCK

FUCK FUCK FUCK!

I'm missing it! Shit! Where's my HUD when I need it? Damn it!

Everyone's getting the fucking points but me!

Why is the ONE GODDAMN DAY I don't have my HUD, they show a rare ad on the train?!

I bet it's for some hot new chrome or something too, damn lucky bastards!

Gahhh aaaand this is my stop. 

How did people even survive without HUDs back in the day, my god.
