Heya! Welcome back to another month of crippling burnout. This discreet math class, as stated earlier, will end me.

## Cabin work

I did some work on that open source cabin game, then had to refactor as I had built everything on the grid3d node in godot, which does not support nodes, but only meshes. Oops. Luckily I have feature parity with the original design using a world grid snapping system instead. Yippee! 

I've got some simple construction in, but not yet at the fidelity that I want for this vertical slice. I still have to figure out how to apply an incomplete shader to placed objects and also allow materials to be added to them, which is probably as simple as just toggling the render style on certain nodes in the object as items are placed. Still, on the todo list. Also resource gathering and processing are still on the todo list but that's still a long way off.

## Niri v25.11

She's out and she's a beauty! My little change is in here somewhere, but it's just incredible to see what the open source community can put together. [Patchnotes here](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/discussions/2917)!

## Twee Narrative

This is technically for school, but it gets a pass to be in here because it's so cool. 

Essentially, I'm to make a little 10 minute narrative experience in twee. (Technically the class wants twine but GUIs are for losers & I have the power of CI/CD on my side). I have hopelessly overscoped this bitch and am now gazing down the barrel of having to write content for the thing. 

Basically, it's trying to tell a story through random events. And I added a weather system because immersion (someone kill me before I scope creep myself onto olympus). Purely text based, but I hope to make something genuinely cool here (and if you're any good at github scraping you'll probably be able to see what I'm cooking up). Looking forward to sharing more details when I get the thing out by finals!

## Them

Fresh new cyberpunk hot off the press! I love me a little creative short story here and there, and I hope you enjoy this latest entry into whatever the fuck I'm making these days. [Here it is](/writing/them)!

## November Nodeletter

Back at it again, the godot nodeletter for november is out! [Thar she blows](https://godot.news/archive/the-nodeletter-november-0885)!

# Retrospective

Ok guys, I know. Nike's. 

How about this: I'll make you a deal, if any single person, one (1) person, including people that know me IRL, I'm not picky, sends me an email at kai@fireye.coffee saying that they care about Nike's and want to see it finished, I'll work on it in any little spare time I have, and aim to finish it by the end of the year. 

As for that nixOS post, I got no excuse on that one either. I just didn't get the spare time to chill and do some blogging. At some point I'm going to have to cut out the time though, sorry about that, if anyone happens to care. ADHD is tough shit for consistency.

# Plans

I've been feeling the TTRPG itch a bit in recent days, so I might look at picking up an old TTRPG project soonish. Probably going to have to wait until after finals though. 

Also apparently "Wild West TTRPG system" puts one of these blog posts on the first page of search results, holy SEO batman! I think that contractually means I have to work on it again, so maybe expect more of that soon.

## Conclusion

And that's the game! It's about midnight at time of writing so I'm off to get some sleep. Thanks for reading once again, and have a great day.
