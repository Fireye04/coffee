            <p>I do love me some projects, even if finishing them is
                a point of concern. If you want me to finish something,
                let me know! It's really nice to know someone actually
                cares about anything I'm doing <strike>and I'll do anything
                  for external validation!</strike></p>

            <h2 class="under" id="right-now">What am I doing right now?</h2>

            <p>This section is essentially the projects that are currently in my
            field of vision, and are being actively worked on to some degree.

            <h4 id="tavern2">Tavern 2 | Godot (2024)</h4>

            <p class="indent">A couple months worth of work so far, tavern 2 is my first long-term
            project I've attempted in quite some time. It's a game concept rooted in the idea
            of a stardew-valley-esque tavern management sim with deep relationship and bartering
            mechanics. At the moment I'm working on a tech demo before I start going public with
            development, but I plan to get said demo done before the end of August 2024. (cut to
            me not updating the website post august and getting bullied by the 2 whole
            <strike>visitors</strike> bots that notice). You can check granular progress with the
            link below that I actually keep up to date.

            site for a while, but now it's finally here! I'll keep working on it
            as much as I can to get the overall structure up to snuff then I'll
            just update the content.

            <p class="indent">This is a little game I made with a couple friends.
            This was my first game jam and we actually finished on time,
            which is probably a miracle of some kind. We used UE4.
            Yes, UE4 the 3d game engine with a 2d module that,
            to my knowledge, ceased development a while ago. Fun times.
