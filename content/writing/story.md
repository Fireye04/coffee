title: The Party
---
Why am I here? I know I don't like parties. It's so loud. All I've been doing is standing in the corner, holding an almost empty cup, watching everyone have a good time. It's so wierd how people are able to just have fun at parties. Or maybe I'm the wierd one. I check my watch. 11:35. I've been here for an hour and a half. I look around for Allison, my roomate and unfortunately my ride. I catch a glimpse of her, very drunk, leaned over on some guy. Typical. 

"You're scowling" Notes a voice to my left. I turn. Like everyone else at this party, I don't recognize them. They're short and well dressed, eyes adorned with some admittedly beautiful makeup. They're wearing a casual smirk as they look at me, one that conveys a confusing amount of familiarity. "It's a party, you're supposed to enjoy yourself, no?" They say.

"I don't know you." I say, looking them over suspiciously.

"Nope! But why go to a party if not to talk to strangers?" They ask.

"Because your bitchass roomate bulied you into it?" I offer, glaring daggers at Allison. The nerve on her, finally asking me to do something with her then abandoning me for some boytoy the moment we get here.

"Well I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been in this corner?" They ask.

"An hour and thirty seven minutes." I answer. "But who's counting?"

"Jeez, that sucks. Tried talking to people?" They ask. "You meet all types, case in point" They gesture to me with a slim grin.

"Yeah, unfortunately I bring a certain vibe to the table that people generally don't love" I say, recalling the many many awkward, silent, or plain failed interactions I'd had with others over the years, the most recent one at that very party. "I'm complete garbage at socializing. It's a minor miracle that I haven't yet fucked up this conversation in one way or another." They laugh. That's new. 

"I'll tell you a secret" they say. "You can't really fuck up a conversation when your metric of success is human connection." 

"How do you figure that? I reckon I could pretty easily." I respond

"Okay, worst case scenario, let's say I walk up to you and I say: 'Hi! You're incredibly ugly, and I thought I should let you know.', what do you do?" 

"I tell you to piss off."

"Boom. There you go" They say, grinning.

"What? You clearly fucked that interaction up."

"Ah! But it was an interaction, was it not?"

"I mean... yes?"

"That's human connection! To me, I've succeeded."

"I just told you to piss off! That's hardly a connection" I sputter.

"Potato, potato" They say with a shrug, pronouncing both words identically. "And consider, It'll never get that bad because you're never going to intentially insult a stranger. There's no way to go but up!" 

"You're crazy" I say a smile creeping its way onto my face.
