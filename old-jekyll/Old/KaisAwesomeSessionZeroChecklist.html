        <ol>
            <li>
                Favorite aspect of d&d. What do they like about TTRPGs? 
                What kind of things do they want to happen? Is there any 
                "cool moment" that they really wanna have at some point? 
                Usually you'll get things like "world building" or "puzzles" 
                or "social subterfuge", but it really depends on the players. 
                This really helps you set the tone for the campaign 
                and how you plan it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Campaign specifics. How long do you wanna run this for? 
                <i>(A good rule of thumb is when you estimate the amount of 
                time for players to complete a certain amount of content, 
                multiply it by ~2-4 to get the actual amount)</i>. How 
                frequently are you meeting? Will it be the same day/time every 
                week or not? Where are you meeting week to week? Will there be 
                food? Snacks? If so, who brings the food/snacks? 
            </li>

            <li>
                Absences. Establish a quorum with everyone, and decide what 
                they want to do with their characters when absent. ("give 
                control to another player" and "has something else to do 
                canonically" are the 2 most common options) If you 
                don't meet quorum do you still want to meet anyway and 
                play board games instead? Also I like to implement a 3 strike 
                rule. The way I usually run it is "if you no-show a session 
                without at least 24 hours of advance warning that's one strike, 
                3 strikes and you're out." This is also established on a 
                case by case basis though so if someone has an emergency, 
                I don't rule that as a strike. You can be as loose or as 
                rigid with it as you want, but it's really good to have 
                from the get-go.
            </li>

            <li>   
                Vibes. Ask everyone what kind of campaign they want and 
                have them put percentages on the following scales: 
                silly/ serious and RP/Combat (eg: 30% silly, 70% serious; 
                90% RP, 10% Combat). If there are any polar disagreements 
                here (including on your part) talk it over. If you're too 
                split here, and nobody wants to budge, it might just not be 
                a good group. If this the case, it's good to note this early 
                and potentially stop before you realize nobody is having 
                any fun. 
            </li>

            <li>              
                Safety tools. It's better to have them and not need them than 
                the other way around. The 
                <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Card.">X Card</a> 
                is a good option.
            </li>


            <li>
                Lines and veils. Topics that people don't want to come 
                up at the table. Lines are red flag no-no topics that you 
                should avoid writing into the story at all, and veils are 
                more of a "it's ok if you fade to black/glaze over it rather 
                than going into detail but be careful". I like to describe 
                both then leave the table open for suggestions. This isn't 
                the only framework for this kind of discussion, so encourage 
                your players to talk about sensitive topics in whatever way 
                they feel comfotable with. For example, a player might be 
                alright with going into a certain theme, but only if it's 
                being handled in a certain way. Also make sure that players 
                know they can direct message you if they're not comfortable 
                saying in front of everyone else. The most important thing 
                here is that everyone should be having fun, so if one person 
                says something's off limits, it goes, no questions asked. 
            </li>

            <li> 
                Open the floor to any additional notes that players might 
                want to add. Address any of these, and once you do that, 
                you can move on to...
            </li>

            <li>
                Character creation! I specifically ask players not to bring 
                any character to session 0. Just potential ideas. Give them 
                a brief intro to the world, 
                ask for questions, then let them loose. I'd start with a 
                race and class, then jump right into backstories, as those 
                influence pretty much everything else. Encourage them to 
                link backstories with each other. I require my players to 
                have at least 3 relevant NPCs that mean something to their 
                character. This grounds them in the world and can serve for 
                some really nice plot hooks later down the line. Here you 
                also want to set the campaign's starting parameters. 
                Where are they meeting and how did they get there? Once 
                backstories are done, have them finish character sheets. 
                Bada bing Bada boom, session 0 complete.
