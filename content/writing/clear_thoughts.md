Bored! 
Bored, Bored, Bored!
Bororororeedddddd. 
Boooooorrrrrrr--
Ah shit, you've gone and stepped in a puddle, great job gonkhead, now your socks are wet.
Why the hell is it even rainy, anyway? 
Those dumbasses at Auracorp aren't doing their damn jobs.
Ugh, squish, squish, squish, Ick, Ick, Ick.
God I can't with these damn socks. 
I'll take em off at the stop.
...
Oh wait Mac said they were chroming up their left arm today; I should check in to see how they're doing.
Ah kratz, right, my fucking HUD is gone, great.
Fuck this Hud upgrade, man I thought it would be easy.
Shoulda gone for that loaner HUD, you cheap gonk.
How did people even survive without HUDs, my god.
Finally here, that walk is so much longer than I realized it was.
Oh train's here... finally. Ugh.

Man I don't think I've ever gone this far in the day without hearing the news one way or another.
