  <h2>About Fireye.Coffee</h2>

<p>My goal with this site was to make something I could put all of my projects onto, but also be a project itself. If I want to add something to it, I sit down and figure out how it works on a base level and work out how to do it myself. In this way i’ve managed to implement static site generation for a blog, an easter egg or two, and even a custom backend for my guestbook (running on cloudflare workers). The site’s base code was taken from https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com (which is under WTFPL license) and adapted to create something personal. Icons are from <a href="https://iconoir.com/">iconnoir</a>, available under an MIT license. It’s not much: mostly just plaintext. But it’s responsive, meaning it works on all screen sizes, it has (moderately) fast load times on its backend, and aside from its domain name, it’s completely free.</p>
