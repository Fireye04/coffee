TTRPGs are awesome, so I decided to do a blog series reviewing and analyzing certain TTRPGs as I read through and eventually run each. In this post I'll go over 
- Why TTRPGs
- What I plan to look at on each
- Which ones I plan to go over

## Why TTRPGs?

Because, simply put, TTRPGs are the best medium for entertainment, storytelling, and creative expression. No movie can beat the sheer immersion of a well crafted TTRPG. No video game can beat the limitless options and directions of a TTRPG. No book can beat the social connection and creative stimulation of friends around a table forming legends in real time. Nothing against these other mediums, and they definitely have their boons: No need for scheduling, the complex caclulus that goes on behind the scenes in a video game that even the most technically minded of TTRPGers would shudder to perform in real time, and the coziness of a good book cannot be denied. TTRPGs, at least in my eyes though, are the clear standout. But then again this is coming from an ADHDer who's hyperfixated on TTRPGs since they were in 3rd grade, so feel free to take this position with a grain of salt. I'm still gonna talk about it though and NOONE CAN STOP ME MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

## What I Plan to Look Over

This is probably subject to change based on what TTRPG I happen to be looking at, however here are the broadstrokes of my approach.

- 

## Which TTRPGs am I Gonna Look at

My choices are probably gonna be biased towards more RP heavy systems, as that's what I tend to prioritize in my gameplay experience.

- The Wildsea
- Blades in the Dark
- Spire
- Heart
