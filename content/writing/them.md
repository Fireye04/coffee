The first time I met them was in middle school. 
They walked up to me, step by deliberate step as I hung in the boy's restroom, our eyes meeting somewhere far away; Anywhere, everywhere, but here. 
They stopped; I felt a whisper of their outstretched hand caressing my cheek. 
They were real. I was sure of it. 
I managed to crack my mouth open to utter something. 
Nothing came out. That moment lasted an eternity. 
There was a profound sadness in their eyes, a longing for a time long past. 
A deep pity for the broken husk that hung before them. 
I would have given everything to ask them what it was. 
To stay in that moment with them just a little longer. 
Then with a loud "crack!" I came crashing back to reality, narrowly avoiding becoming the 121st kid that year to kill themselves.
Which was fortunate, as that's one of my least favorite statistics.

When I woke up, the doctor told me there was nobody else in that restroom.
Nobody I asked seemed to recognize them. 
I must have hacked into the school's database at least a dozen times, all to no avail. 
The mystery person simply didn't exist. 
Ironically, my search for them kept me going for another few years, until finally a few months after graduating high school, I succeeded. 

I had been taking side gigs netrunning for cyberwatch's intelligence wing just to keep the food coming while I searched for Them. 
They had become an obsession of mine, which was probably a good thing. 
You can't survive in the modern day without something keeping you going; Some have lofty ideals, some have hard drugs, i just had Them. 

I had been evicted from my cargo crate the week earlier;
Just one of the 120,995 that would be evicted in such a way this year.
As a result, I had picked up an extra gig or two to have the scratch to afford a roof over my head. 
There's a reason everyone tells you to avoid gig work for corps (12,492 "work related" deaths this year), but I was young and thought I could get away with it. 
And I really needed the money. 
All I know is that one moment I was under, and the next I was wrenched back into my body, looking directly into their eyes again as they lay next to me. 
How I had missed those eyes. *Hello again* they seemed to say, regretfully. 
The sting of the dozen or so holes in my torso was reduced to little more than a subtle tone that echoed across my body. 
Like the dial tone on my dad's old rotary phone he bought after the old net collapsed. 
I was determined to speak to them this time. 
To say something, anything. I managed little more than a weak cough and a "Who?" carried over the whisper of whatever air happened to remain in my tattered lungs. 
I think I already knew, subconsciously, but the little smile they gave me all but confirmed it. 

Death. 

How anyone could fear such a beautiful and delicate creature was beyond me. 
I inched my hand towards theirs and they took it tenderly. 
I smiled, the muted tone echoing through my body subsiding to a fuzzy static. 
I didn't care. For the first time in my life, bleeding out in an abandoned building, I was alright. 
Content to spend the short remainder of my life laying there motionless, looking into their prismatic eyes, the depths of which seemed to know no bounds. 
The immediate pity was obvious but behind that I could clearly identify a heavier sadness, grounded in an ocean of exhaustion. 
How long had they been alive? What had they seen? Experienced? Felt? 
Fuck, now I was the one pitying them. Had they had a single break? Or were they forced to witness statistic after statistic?
And why me? I knew these statistics like the back of my hand: there were at least twenty other people in that city dying at that very instant. 
Why spend precious time lying in the dirt with some fucking gonk? 
Whatever the reason, I slowly mouthed a word of thanks at them. 
They squeezed my hand, which for some reason brought tears to my eyes.

A million miles away, a noise played. 
Almost a recording of a glass vase falling, shattering, played back as quietly as speakers would allow. 
Then voices. Annoying voices. Like the voices that played on dad's post-old net radio. 
Dad. I think i forgave him a bit in that moment. 
He must have met Death as well. He must have known them like I did. 
Why else would you kill yourself with a 13 year old kid to take care of? 
Especially with a motto like "Don't add to the statistics."

Ironically, he was one of 305 parental suicides that year and my mother one of the 292 of the previous year.
I was confident I wouldn't add to that specific statistic, though. 
Being a parent is evil and I refused to take part in such actions.

I felt my body lurch. Odd. 
I certainly didn't have the strength for such things. 
A pinch on my arm echoed across my hollow consciousness, followed quickly by a burning sensation that rapidly replaced the comfortable radio fuzz. 
The lurch happened again. 
Wait, I was moving. Death! Where were they? 
We couldn't be separated again. I wouldn't allow it. 
Ignoring the fire in my veins and the screaming voices in my head I lurched up, writhing back and forth. Loud shouting ensued.
I spotted them back on the ground where we laid seconds before, sitting up, looking at me with a hopeful smile. 
I felt another pinch as we locked eyes. They mouthed a silent "go", and the world melted away. 

I awoke pissed in a hospital bed. Someone was going to pay for have taken me away from Them.

"Your rescue wasn't cheap, kid" a voice stated behind me. I turned, conealing my seething anger.
A woman in a dark black suit, seated at my beadside studied me with a jaded look. It figures, a fucking corpo.
I knew the deal.

"What do you want."

"Information. What you were doing for cyberwatch, what you got, contacts, names, the lot." 

"Done. I have full logs and stats on my cyberdeck." She smiled. She must have been desperate, going after a contract worker like me; corps always keep us at an arm's length to protect against this kind of stuff. She rifled through a bag, pulling out my cyberdeck. She handed it to me along with a chip.

"Address and instructions are on here." I nodded, taking it and typing my passkey in deliberately. 
A screech leapt out of the device, high pitched and unbelievably loud. 
Her hands involuntarily leapt to her ears as the monotone sound poured out of the device. 
In high school I had modded that frequency of sound out of my auditory range, specifically to enable my cyberdeck as a defensive weapon.
Clearly it had paid off.

I inputted a few keystrokes, and was met with my usual list of options. I disdainfully picked the quickest, and shut off the audio. 
She removed her hands from her ears, glaring at me.

"You little..." A loud electrical pop emitted from her head, and the left side of her face went slack. Poor bastard, one of 83 this year.
I slowly eased my way out of the bed, as she fell to her knees behind me, a slurry of biomechanical sludge beginning to drip from her nose. 
I took a few weak steps towards the window as a dull thump signaled the end of her short journey to the floor. 
I took an apprehensive sigh as I inputted a couple more keystrokes into my device, opening the window to the outside. 

"I'm coming back, honey," I mutter as I gaze out over the city, beautiful, haunting, and uncaring as ever. 
I give it a little smile as I finally contribute my tick mark to the statistics.
