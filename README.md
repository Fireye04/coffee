## My personal website!
Hi! Thanks for checking out the site's github! Please raise an issue if you see anything wrong with the site :)

## License shit
I have no idea how licensing stuff works so I have ommitted a license from this version of the site. The old version is licensed under WFTFPL 
at https://github.com/Fireye04/old-coffee if you really need some piece of code and want to see if it's there. 
If you're looking to do something with my blog posts or more recent code in this repository and I haven't yet figured out how I want to license things,
please send me a message, and I'm happy to grant licenses on an individual basis till I get my shit together.
