I write blog posts because they're easy. 
They let me get my ideas down in one place with the lowest possible barriers to publication. 
I'm able to write something and a couple git commands, some staging proofreading, and a pull request later, the thing is just out there.

The downside, of course, is that nobody sees these. 
Except you, of course, Mr. AI webscraper. 
(Tell Sam Altman I said "Die in a hole")

Regardless, it's a lonely business, shouting into the void. 
So, I figured I'd ponder the void a bit on my little corner of the internet.

## Why am I here?

I hate the idea of marketing, but as much as I make broad platitudes about these posts being helpful solely as resources for friends, or as organizational tools, I can't lie. Deep down, I know I need to develop some sort of social following. 

I'm a game developer. 
I want to make games for a living. 
And the sad truth is that the only damn way to do that these days, outside of getting shafted by every AAA studio known to man, is by growing an online following. 

Past that, having a group of people that care about what you're doing sounds really nice.
I've gotten pretty comfortable releasing games and projects to resounding silence, as I don't make them for social validation, but rather to engage in the creative process. 
I do genuinely just love making things, and even if I can't live off them and nobody gives a shit about any of them, I'll still keep making them.
But, heck, social validation is pure gas for pretty much anyone, even if they don't want to admit it, and I'm certainly no excepiton. 

## So what do I do about it?

Well there are a few options.
The first is nothing!
I just continue blogging, like normal.

The second is pretty appealing. 
In this one, I just stop blogging entirely, and just focus on making things.
That's the peaceful way to go, I think;
I get the most time to just create, and don't get bogged down in the administrative overhead of publicating things.
The downside here, of course, is that the afformentioned benefits are completely abandoned, which is, as they say, "Not a vibe."

Finally...

### Youtube

I've stuck off youtube, as it's so much work to get something out there and also "google" (need I say more?).
However, as sad as I am to say it, that's where the people are.
Perhaps here's where I dip my hat and surrender to visual media. 
I definitely wouldn't retire my blog, but perhaps I could intermittently make videos from blog posts, to attempt to tap into youtube's much wider userbase.

My main concern here is that blogging already takes up a good amount of the time that I dedicate to project work, and adding a whole recording and an editing component would just eat far too much to justify, especially if I like making things.
Which I do.

I can't say I'm not tempted to at least give it a shot though. 

## Conclusion

Not much of a conclusion here, mostly just musings.
If I post something on youtube I'll let y'all know as well of course. 
Here's the channel I'll be using.

Maybe I'll see you there.
