Hello! Welcome to my monthly update for June! This being the first of its kind, allow me to explain what exactly I plan to do with this series.

See, I'm always working on things. However, these things very rarely see the light of day, complete or otherwise, so to the outside observer, it appears that I am doing nothing, which is a shame! Further, publicly summarizing my activities and setting goals for the next month allows me to hold myself to some sort of standard and thus do more things. Planning and visualizing the future is also really good for me in terms of ADHD, and being accountable to the internet to do so is a great way to make sure it happens.

TLDR: It's a summary of what I did this month and what I plan to do next month, tied up into a neat retrospective.

So, without further ado, let's kick it off.

## Treehouse TTRPG

I spent a lot of June working on "The Treehouse" (learn more [here](/projects/treehouse)), which is a new TTRPG that I was working on for the "Jam In Silence" Game Jam by possum creek games. I was not able to finish it on time and as such it's sitting incomplete on my hard drive, but damn is it gonna be good when it's done! Imagine a modern setting but focused on the PCs in a tree house where each characters' troubles, flaws and vices are represented as "classes". Feature-wise it's mostly there, with a few additions and tweaks here and there, but content-wise, it's a barren wasteland, which is somewhat terrifying. Definitely gonna return to this soon though, as I'd love to playtest this one with friends.

## Vacation

My first half of june was claimed by a trip to spain, which was a breath of fresh air compared to the ins and outs of life over here. Functional public transport was really nice and the spanish siesta was truly iconic. The sun also goes down around 10 in the afternoon, which does wonders for my sleep schedule, and surprisingly everything is open past 7:15. Wild.

## Open source contributions

I also started going down the open source rabbit hole. I did some work on the godot project (nothing major, just regression testing), and generally went out of my way to open tickets, do testing, and work with smarter developers to contribute to any number of random FOSS projects. The highlight reel consists of the embedded game window over wayland in godot, a bug in the xwayland-satellite project, and some work on the niri WM.

## Niri

Welp it took me this long to realize that the hyprland maintainer is a bigot. Neat. Time to find a new WM. Enter niri! Niri is awesome! It's still a bit rough around the edges (It doesn't support release keybinds yet and scratchpads are sorely missing), however I love it. It took me about a week of literally nothing else, but it's all set up, and now I can do any single productive thing (please). I'm tracking a lot of issues on its github, and I can't wait for it to get better.

## Nike's house

It's still happening! I promise! Treehouse really put a wrench in my progress here, as I wanted to make a TTRPG, and that jam seemed like a great opportunity, however I've since sidelined treehouse and I'm back working on nike's. I'm hoping to get it done by august time, but no promises. There's a lot more to it than I had hoped but I've made some steady progress.

I added an event tracker so the game can keep track of what you've said and which paths you've gone down, as well as a few api tweaks so that when I sit back down to do more writing I can make more tweaks to the gameplay from within the dialogue. I also cooked on a bit of dialogue and plot structure stuff but I'm not locked into anything specifically so I won't drop anything specific here in case I happen to change my mind haha.

## Disco elysium

In less productive areas, I have played disco elysium to completion! My goodness that was good.
