It's september time, and I'm unfathomably cooked. This is gonna be a short one, and I think I need sleep. 

## Why so short, batman?

Well, I got really really really sick for about a week, then was buried under the resulting schoolwork for the next two, and here I am. I've done what I could in that time, but have been largely cooked.

## Niri WM Hot corners

[WE'RE MERGED BABY!!!](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/pull/2108) Compile the WM from its main branch to grace your eyes with fully configurable per-monitor hot corners courtesy of yours truly. Doccumented [here](https://yalter.github.io/niri/Configuration%3A-Outputs.html#hot-corners)! 

Eventually I'm looking at potentially adding spawn and spawn-sh functionality to hot corners as well, but that's closer to a thought marinating in the back of my head than an actual thing that's happening. If it catches my fancy on a cool autumn day, perhaps I might pick it up. Until then, enjoy!

## Motherboard update

Well, the mobo might be cooked. After ordering and consulting an annoyingly silent POST beeper, I've come to the conclusion that somehow the POST circut is simply just not triggering in the first place, which SUCKS, as that's the thing that's supposed to start everything and/ or tell me what's gone wrong. Might try to do some contact tracing if I can find a half decent schematic somewhere but who the hell knows. If anyone knows the Strix Z-690-F Gaming Wifi moderately well, or knows how a POST circut works, please feel free to reach out! 

## Music

I played music! I recorded stuff! I haven't recorded stuff since I was on arch, so I had to reconfigure my audio setup on nix, but ardour works great now, and I'm getting to work!

> Did you finish anything?

Next topic!

## Games!

### Hades 2

I've been selfishly saving myself for the full release of Hades 2 through the open early access, as I loved the original hades and wanted to experience the second completely fresh. And seeing that it released last week I've been doing so! It's been genuinely one of the best games I've ever played and I don't think I'm even halfway through. I'll almost certaintly do a post on it once I finish the thing, but suffice it to say I've been having an incredible time with it and the chaos redesign was literally life changing. 

### Hollow Knight

While I was sick I was able to 104% the originl hollow knight. I haven't done the true ending yet, but I thouroughly enjoyed it, with a few annoyances here and there. I might do another post on it as well, but I'll wait till I get that true ending to do so. The writing is unfathomably powerful and it's fucking bonkers how much they're able to do with so little. I ended up crying twice through my playthrough and each such encounter had a number of dialogue lines that you could count on one hand. Truly impressive work, and I'm looking forward to picking up silksong when I get the time. 

## Where's the NixOS post, Jon? 

It's being worked on, I promise! I'm still learning things about nix (yes even a whole ass month and a half after switching, NixOS is one hell of a rabbit hole, let me tell you), and I'd like to make it as good as it can be. I have an [open PR to nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/444104) and I'd love to have that merged before I do the full post so I can fully write about what I've learned from it (though nixpkgs is huge and might very well take a while). 

What I can say is this far in, I don't regret the switch. NixOS makes so much sense and I'm delighted to say the bad stuff get so much better with time. I did half regret switching at first but I think the brain worm finally ended up taking hold, so I'm grateful for that at least :P.

# Retrospective

I think I did well considering the circumstances. Mostly just annoyed that I didn't work on nike's. I think the scope is intimidating me a little bit, but that's just a matter of making myself sit down and chip away at it little by little. 

# Plans

Alright here's the deal. I'm going to put some stuff on the back burner as little as I'd like to do that, so I can focus on what actually needs to get done.

Main list:
- Nike's
- Open VPN Config
- Music Recording

Backlog:
- Treehouse RPG
- NixOS Blog post
- Motherboard Repair
- Niri Hot corner updates
- Hollow knight blog post

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading again! If you made it this far, go look up a picture of chaos from hades 2 as a reward. You're welcome, and I'll see you next month! Vaya con queso!
