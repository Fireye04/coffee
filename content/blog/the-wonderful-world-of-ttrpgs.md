One thing I get a lot from D&D 5e players is the statement "What's all this about non-5e systems? 5e is all I need!" 
Or at least something along those lines. 
This is a depressing statement from just one person, let alone an entire population, so I've dedicated this blog post to all the 5e players out there. 
Please, just hear a tired game designer out on this one. 
There's a world of fun out there that you're very likely missing out on, and my goal in this piece is to show you the possibilities. 
What you do from there is up to you. 

# D&D 5e is not for everyone


## What even is a TTRPG?

This sounds like a relatively simple question, especially for someone already familiar with the medium, but bear with me for a second. 
Especially you, random GM that says "Oh i'll just modify 5e for this," every time you want to tell a different kind of story.

> A TTRPG is a collection of rules and mechanics that when put together create a system for often collaborative storytelling. 

The key point of this definition that I want to point out is that the end goal is **telling a story**. 
This end goal of storytelling is super important, as your system's collection of rules and mechanics is, essentially, a well-oiled machine tailor built and tested to make a specific kind of story. 

See, in game design, (specifically TTRPG design, but many concepts apply more broadly), well-built systems are intentionally made up of mechanics that build towards a central thesis. 
This thesis can include critically important things, such as genre, setting, mood, tone, and even themes for the stories made within that system.
We just simply don't have the same level of narrative control that other artistic mediums do, however, what we have, that they don't, is a direct line of communication with the player directly: mechanics.
So, we put a living shit ton of work into making arrays of mechanics that perfectly build towards our thesis, as that's how we convey artistic vision in place of raw narrative.

My main point here is thus: **in modifying rules and mechanics, you are fundimentally sacrificing the designer's thesis.**

At the same time, it's your game, and you are 100% within your rights to modify, tweak, and break things to your heart's content. I encourage such behavior actually! It's probably one of the best ways to learn game design! However, in doing so you should at least acknowledge that, at least to some degree, you are killing the designer's child, and with it, their intentions, design, thesis, and all of the elements therein.

### Specificity and vagueness by design, a sidenote

Some systems are intentionally vague or broad to expand the number of stories that can be told with them. 
Genesys and FATE (which, in turn, is based on "fudge," The more you know!) are good examples of such systems. 
And they definitely have their uses; Edge of the Empire was built on Genesys, and that system uses the genesys dice system unfathomably well.  

However, broader systems fundimentally sacrifice their capacity to carry out their mechanical vision when they choose flexibility over specialization. 
In short, when you try to do everything, you do nothing well. 
Would you rather have one multitool that kinda handles everything kinda ok, or an array of specialized tools, each designed specifically and lovingly with their own hyperspecific application in mind?

5e is designed as a combat system and has been adapted into an everything system by its players. 
All I'm trying to say is that it's designed vaguely, and if anything specializes in combat. 
But heck, it doesn't even do that extraordinarily well, due to its lack of focus!

In a world where people are lovingly crafting games about high school drama and gossip, games about sailing on trees on a chainsaw boat, games about living dungeons that gaze directly into the characters' very souls, games about kids hoverboarding between dimensions, and infinitely many more, each with its own new ideas, mechanics, vibes, artistic visions, and theses... **GASPS FOR AIR**

Why in the everliving fuck would you want to play with a multitool?

## RP enthusiasts, I'm looking at you.

Hey. I'm talking to you, roleplay enjoyers that just default to 5e because you don't want to learn a new system.
And I'm especially talking to the RP-focused 5e groups out there that simply just don't run combat. Or do so very infrequently. 

Because like it or not, 5e is a **medival fantasy-based** system designed **primarily for combat**. 

So, if you're looking to do anything else, you're genuinely missing out on a system that was specifically designed to mechanically create the story that you and your party actually want to play.

The medival fantasy focus is self explanatory (A standard modern setting, for example, wouldn't have pack horses as items and "arcana" as a skill), however, on the combat front, I expect I'll get a good amount of pushback. 
Nontheless I stand by that. 5e is built for combat first and roleplay second. 
Allow me to elaborate:

### The entire system centers around combat

In 5e, what percentage of class features, conservatively, center around combat mechanics? How about Feats? Items? 
How much session time does combat take up? It certainly depends on the group, but I've certainly run 7 hour combat sessions before. 

Further, the sheer moment-to-moment detail of the system is nothing short of a second game mode.
One must keep track of player & enemy positions, initiative order, player & enemy action economy, hit points, and everything must be done within ~6 second actions within the fiction.
I'll have more to say about the combat later on, but if you're using this for RP it's like hammering a nail with a jackhammer: it's overbuilt in all the wrong ways, and you'd be much better off investing the budget in a nail gun if all you wanted to do was nail nails.

The balance of the combat system is built for numerous combat sessions between long rests. 
And from personal experience running low-combat 5e campaigns, I don't think my party ever went more than two bouts of combat between long rests, rendering the combat balance way off (casters rarely ran out of spell slots, making them far more powerful than martials).

If you want to add something or have a player come up with an item or a trait for their character, as a GM you either

- have to be concerned with how it will be balanced/ abused in combat, or
- don't run combat anyway, and end up ignoring the many many 5e mechanics that center around it.
 
### Its roots are literally in war gaming.

The creators of D&D were members of the international federation for war gaming (one of which co-founded the thing), which then branched off into a subgroup called the castle & crusade society, which then set the foundation for the chainmail system, which was a foundation for the original D&D ruleset. Go figure. ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20141227073557/http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-dd/history/history-forty-years-adventure))

The very basis for the 5e system is anchored in war games. 
It has indeed evolved to encompass much more, but it has almost certainly kept its roots. 
As a baseline, all the non-combat is a design afterthought compared to combat, which is what the system was made for! 
In short, D&D will never be a roleplay-focused TTRPG system and still be D&D.

### A small capitulation.

This isn't to say that you *can't* use 5e or any other D&D based system for incredible RP-based storytelling. You totally can! 
I've done so myself, and I absolutely adore what GMs like Brennan Lee Mulligan and Matt Mercer do with the system. 
However, just because a system is popular, doesn't mean it's the system that will give the most enjoyment to you and your party.

Since my fascination with tabletop RPGs hit, I've had so many incredible experiences and told so many beautiful stories that never could have *ever* happened in 5e, raw or modded to the teeth.
And my goal with this piece is to hopefully share that with you.

You don't gotta take it, or heck, do anything with it. By all menas, play what makes you happy, even if it is 5e.




## Combat enjoyers aren't off the hook either

## Perhaps newbies?

## Who is 5e for? 


Play specific games!!!

#### Sidenote

Some systems are intentionally vague or broad to expand the number of stories that can be told with them, 

Every time I hear someone who likes TTRPGs say they're not interested in learning other systems, that simply sounds to me like someone who enjoys art saying "Nah the mona lisa is my favorite, I'm not going to go and enjoy other art" Or someone who likes movies saying "I really like the avengers im not going to watch anything else ever." Like what????
