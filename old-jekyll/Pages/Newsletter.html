        <h3>How?</h3>

        <p>
            Click the <!--<a href="mailto:website@fireye.coffee?subject=Join Newsletter&body=EMAIL GOES HERE">
                linky thing
            </a>--> above for the email link, or just direct
            an email at website@fireye.coffee containing your email, and
            preferably "Join Newsletter" as the subject line, but I can probably
            figure it out if you don't. Also please don't spam me i'm trusting you &lt;3
        </p>

        <h3>Why the jank?</h3>

        <p>I made a rant that's at the bottom of this page but the TL;DR is:
            My dumbass is incapable of good web design
            so instead of making a real newsletter, I just have an email function
            that lets you send me your email so I can manually add you to a mailing
            list while I cry tears of inadequacy. I would like to add the real thing soon,
            but like a Star Citizen "soon", not a normal person soon.
        </p>

        <h2>Expectations / FAQ</h2>

        <h3>What kinda stuff am I using this for?</h3>

        <p>Right now, it's gonna be exclusively for blog updates. Later on, I might add
            project updates into that but it will be an opt-in process and constitute
            a totally seperate list from this one. (This is in the hypothetical future
            where I figure out how to work a data server for email storage,
            so it's probably not anytime in the next 6 months or so). When I make an
            actual database I plan to have tagged articles and allow users to opt into
            certain topics, but for now it's just everything.
        </p>

        <h3>How regularly will you be sending things?</h3>

        <p>Short answer: Whenever I write a blog post. This is approximately once every
            few months.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I un-sign up?</h3>

        <p>Email me at website@fireye.coffee, preferably with "Leave Newsletter" as the subject line,
            and I'll do the rest. <a href="mailto:website@fireye.coffee?subject=Join Newsletter&body=EMAIL GOES HERE">
                Mailto link
            </a> for convenience
        </p>

        <h2>The rantâ„¢</h2>
        <p>So I was gonna try to make a full ass SQL database that allows me to
            store and access emails in like a really cool way and I was gonna
            run up this open source mailing list manager that was gonna be so cool.
            But then I realized that I'd either have to run it up on my personal server
            (Read: an old shitty laptop that I swapped out the hard drive, added 16gb
            of RAM, and booted to linux to), and run it off of my home wifi (which barely
            manages to handle a 1080p video stream; No providers will offer acceptable
            wifi here I hate everything), OR pay money to have it hosted somewhere.
            The server situation sucks fat nards and I'm too smoothbrained to figure
            out how to set that shit up and link it to my website's domain without tearing
            a dumbass-shaped hole in my local network security. As for option B? I'm
            just broke as shit and can't justify costs here until doing online shit
            starts actually making me money, which honestly sounds like a pipe dream
            now that I'm actually typing it out. Anyway, long story short, this wacky email
            solution is better than having no way to let people know that I've posted
            something. As if anyone would care anyway lmao.
